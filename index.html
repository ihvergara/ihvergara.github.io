            <h2>What is my favorite CMSC subject so far and why<span class="qsmark">?</span></h2>
            <p>My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 56/57, Discrete Mathematical
                Structures in Computer Science Series because it provides the <br> necessary mathematical foundations
                in  computer science. 
               The concepts in this course are reocurring and <br>  it really helped me on higher
                cmsc subjects that I'm currently taking.

            <h2>What is my favorite GE so far and why<span class="qsmark">?</span></h2>
            <p>My favorite GE so far is HIS 1. The history that I learned back in elementary and
                hs days is very different compared to what I read this college.
                <br> It made me appreciate our rich history.
                Sir JC Santos also contributed why this is my favorite GE so far. 
            </p>

            <h2>What is my favorite programming language so far and why<span class="qsmark">?</span></h2>
            <p>My favorite programming language so far is R. I really enjoyed CMSC 150 and it is also said that
                it is widely used in data science, which is my target career path.
